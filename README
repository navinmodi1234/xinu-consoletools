   This directory contains the source for the complete set of XINU Lab console tools.  This includes the client-side programs cs-console and cs-status, as well as the cserver daemon and all of its support utilities.

   Contents:
	build/		Makefiles.
	cserver/	Source for cserver daemon.
	hdr/		Headers shared between all the utilities.
	lib/		Libraries (mostly networking calls) shared by all
			the utilities.
	man/		Man pages for many of the commands.  Some recent.
			Some less recent.
	programs/	Source for cs-* utilities.
	reboot/		Completely unrelated set of source for communicating
			with the terminal annex.  Supplies the be-reset
			command used by the cserver daemon.
	scripts/	Supporting scripts and wrappers.  Some recent.
			Some less recent.

INSTALLATION

   Change directory to build/<arch>-<os>.  On Linux machines, type "make".
On CS Department Solaris boxes, type "/usr/local/gnu/make".  All of the
executables will be built in that directory.
   The "install" clauses of the Makefiles are largely out of date.
It's probably a lot easier to install by hand:

	Copy cs-console and cs-status to /p/xinu/bin.
	Copy all other executables to /p/xinu/sbin.
	Check modes and ownerships on everything.  Latest installation has
		0555 brylow:newxinu on /p/xinu/bin/*, and 
		0555 root:newxinu on /p/xinu/sbin/*.
	Cserver will look for config file in /p/xinu/etc, and logging
		directory in /p/xinu/etc/conlog.
	Man pages should be copied to /p/xinu/man/man1.
