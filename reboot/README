   This directory contains what we believe to be the complete set of
source for communicating with the XINU Lab terminal annex.  Now that the
backend console lines all run to a shiny, new, SCSI-bus annex, the only
use for this code is to run the old rebooter.  As the new rebooter is
being built even as I write this, we shouldn't need to keep this code
around for much longer.
   But that has been said about many pieces of software in the past, with
widely varying degrees of accuracy.

INSTALLATION

   Change directory to libannex.  Run make.
   Change directory to be-reset.  Run make.
   Copy be-reset executable to /p/xinu/sbin, or whereever the cserver daemon
currently expects to find it.

NOTES

   This code has NOT been ported to Linux yet, nor has it even been evaluated
for potential portability.  It runs on the current Solaris server, and really
should not be needed for much longer.
